In this repository, I demosnstrated the relationship model between predictor and response variable.
The predictor vector stores the heights of persons, whereas the response vector stores the weights of persons.
I printed the summary of the relationship and also determined the weights of the new person by putting the height of the persons. 
Finally Visualised the realtionship graphically.
